[Astro.js 2](https://astro.build/) is a new static website generator that can help you build any website fast. It is currently what is powering my blog www.bitdoze.com and I have just started working with it a couple of weeks.

Being at the beginning it doesn't have a lot of courses out here that can help you learn it. It can be difficult to learn especially for someone that is not into javascript and static website generators. That's why to learn it I will get whatever I can.

In the past, I have written an article with [Best Gatsby.Js Online Courses](https://www.bitdoze.com/gatsby-js-online-courses/) that can help you get started with Gatsby, and here I plan to do the same thing.
