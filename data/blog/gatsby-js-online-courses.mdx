[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)it's a react framework that can help you build headless websites. It's built on react and can quickly help you spin o website.
Bitdoze.com is built on Gatsby and in this article, I would like to show you some Gatsby courses that can help you get started with Gatsby as your framework.

Gatsby is more complicated then WordPress and if you are new it can be scary at the beginning, thatâ€™s why a good course can help you understand what is all about and build your website with modern technologies.

There are some videos out there on YouTube that can get you started but they are basic and will not help you understand Gatsby if you are new. For beginners, the best would be to have a dedicated course done that will bring you thru all of the Gatsby and React functionality.

As a start to get you going with node.js and GitHub you can check: [Install Node.js using NVM](https://www.bitdoze.com/install-nodejs-using-nvm-macos-ubuntu/) and [Link GitHub with A SSH Key](https://www.bitdoze.com/link-github-with-ssh-maco-linux/)

This is the first course I have taken for Gatsby and I can say that is very well explained and it brings you from all the Gatsby features.
John Smilga the author of the course is explaining very well all the things you need to do to have a blog or website build with Gatsby.
