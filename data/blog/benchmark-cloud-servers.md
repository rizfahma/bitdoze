In case you want to use a cloud server for your projects then you should benchmark them to have an idea of what they have to offer. There are a lot of cloud providers out there and the best way to see if the performance is good on a server is to run a test. A good one that you can try is [Hetzner](https://go.bitdoze.com/hetzner), it has decent prices and good performance, in this article we are going to benchmark one of their servers, for more details check this [Hetzner Review](https://www.wpdoze.com/hetzner-cloud-review/).

## What a Good Benchmark Should Check

A good benchmark should take a look on below:

- **Disk Speeds** > These days you have HDD, SSD, or NVME so the speeds may vary from a couple of MB on second to GB. A good VPS should have from hundreds of MB to GB write/read speed.
- **Network Speeds** > in case you are hosting internet-facing applications these speeds are very important the fastest the better, as you need to see the connections with the different data centers.
- **CPU** > The CPU plays a major role and it needs to be tested to see how fast it is. These days relevant tests are the [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com/) ones.

## What Tool to Use to Benchmark Al

[Yabs.sh](https://github.com/masonr/yet-another-bench-script) it’s a small tool that can help you benchmark all of these with a run. This will work on all servers Ubuntu or RedHat and you don’t need to install it to run. For benchmarks to start you just need to run:

    curl -sL yabs.sh | bash

This uses curl to fetch it and run it so you need curl on your VPS (this should be there by default in most distros)
